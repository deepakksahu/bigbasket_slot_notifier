# Big-Basket-Delivery-Slots
It's a major hassle to get delivery slots available on Big Basket due to the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) situation.
This is a small utility script written to automate the process and notify you when a slot becomes available! 

## How to execute the script
This script uses python 3.x.
1) Checkout the repo 
2) Run `pip install -r requirements`
3) Run the script with `python slot_finder.py`

## How to proceed further
1) Make sure your basket is already prepared.
2) A popup opens the first time script is executed. Go to the login tab and login to your account.(Make sure the correct address is selected!)
3) Now wait! Let the script run in the background while you go Netflix. Make sure the laptop does not go to sleep.
4) Once a slot becomes available, a notification will pop up.

Please star the repo if you find the script useful!
